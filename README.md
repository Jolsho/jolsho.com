The initial idea was to build a portfolio website. Then I thought it'd be cool to be able to host a live stream service. That was achieved through the utilization of an rtmp nginx module and server. Essentially I just stream HLS chunks into the nginx server, and the webclient requests those playlists and segments through a sibling Http server. The Http server shares a mounted volume with the nginx container so it can serve without contacting nginx. Nginx contacts the go server for stream authorization and other related features through rtmp hooks. For example when a stream is concluded, the Http server is notified and then rebuilds the .m3u8 hls playlist file to include all chunks, so the same segments can be used for VOD.

Not to mention, I also got some practice with deployment and infrastructure exposure. Got to build some docker images, automate things like cert derivation, DDOS protection, rate limits, and git-hooks.
